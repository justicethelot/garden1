Interactive online art installation created for artist Molly Soda.

“‘Impression’ (2021) transports us to a digital ghost town, where artist Molly Soda displays the decrepitude of a garden of pixels that was never intended to grow old. As we interact with the vacant site, the wild network of weeds is groomed into an idyllic park, becomes cluttered by adverts, and finally culminates as a polished storefront for invasive plants. As functionality returns, bitmap-drawings sharpen, chronicling the aesthetic evolution of an aging internet.”
